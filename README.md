# Hey there, I'm Banana Christian

### 🇺🇬 Developer from Uganda | System Explorer | Tech Realist

I’m deeply fascinated by how things work under the hood from microcontrollers to game engines, from compilers to custom languages. I believe technology isn't just code it's architecture, logic, and craftsmanship.

My mission is simple:  
**Master low-level systems and build tools that make me and others independent.**

---

### Currently Working On:
- **Iron** – A modern, C++-like programming language with simplified syntax and serious speed goals
- **Chapati** – A lightweight 2D game engine in C++, built to teach myself systems-level design *(repo coming soon!)*
- **Arduino & Embedded Systems** Learning the internals of microcontrollers using Wokwi and real boards
- **Phone Connector App** A Flutter-based tool I built to sync/control my devices across multiple screens *(repo coming soon!)*

Let’s build things, break things, and rebuild better.

📬 Reach me for:  
- Collaborating on embedded or low-level projects  
- Sharing ideas around compilers, game engines, or clean app design  
- Or just nerding out on C++, hardware, and systems thinking
