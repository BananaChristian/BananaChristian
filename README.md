# 👋 Hey there, I'm Banana Christian

### 🇺🇬 Developer from Uganda | System Explorer | Tech Realist

I’m deeply fascinated by how things work under the hood — from microcontrollers to game engines, from compilers to custom languages. I believe technology isn't just code — it's architecture, logic, and craftsmanship.

My mission is simple:  
**Master low-level systems and build tools that make me and others independent.**

---

### 🚀 Currently Working On:
- ⚙️ **Quil** – A modern, C++-like programming language with simplified syntax and serious speed goals *(repo coming soon!)*
- 🧠 **Chapati** – A lightweight 2D game engine in C++, built to teach myself systems-level design *(repo coming soon!)*
- 🔌 **Arduino & Embedded Systems** – Learning the internals of microcontrollers using Wokwi and real boards
- 📱 **Phone Connector App** – A Flutter-based tool I built to sync/control my devices across multiple screens *(repo coming soon!)*

---

### 🤝 Join Me:
I believe the best way to learn is by doing — and doing *together*.  
Let’s build things, break things, and rebuild better.

📬 Reach me for:  
- Collaborating on embedded or low-level projects  
- Sharing ideas around compilers, game engines, or clean app design  
- Or just nerding out on C++, hardware, and systems thinking
