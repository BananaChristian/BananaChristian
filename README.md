# 👋 Hey there, I'm Banana Christian

### 🇺🇬 Developer from Uganda | System Explorer | Tech Realist

I’m deeply fascinated by how things work under the hood — from microcontrollers to game engines, from compilers to custom languages. I believe technology isn't just code — it's architecture, logic, and craftsmanship.

My mission is simple:  
**Master low-level systems and build tools that make me and others independent.**

---

### 🚀 Currently Working On:
- ⚙️ Building **Quil**, a C++-like programming language with a cleaner syntax
- 🧠 Developing **Chapati**, a 2D game engine built from scratch in C++
- 🔌 Diving deep into embedded systems with **Arduino** and **Wokwi**
- 📱 Created a custom **multi-device connector app** to sync and control my phones — personal solution to reduce friction and increase productivity

---

### 🤝 Join Me:
I believe the best way to learn is by doing — and doing *together*.  
Let’s build things, break things, and rebuild better.

📬 Reach me for:  
- Collaboration on embedded or low-level projects  
- Sharing ideas around custom languages or game engines  
- Building practical tools that solve everyday problems  
- Or just nerding out on C++, hardware, and systems thinking
